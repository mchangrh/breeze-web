breeze-js

Origins:
- breeze
- sent
- Takahashi Method

Why?
- PowerPoint is a mess
- sent only supports Linux
- breeze only supports Linux and Windows

Images are simple:

This text will not be displayed, since the @ at the start of the first line
makes this paragraph an image slide.

The text-based sent format:
- Keeps the focus on the content;
- Can be edited with any tool;
- And is easy to share

Benefits over breeze:
- It runs in browser;
- Basic styling is possible
  in the presentation file

What you see is what you get:
The text is displayed exactly as you typed it;
No wrapping is done automatically

Usage:
tbd

- One slide per paragraph;
- Lines starting with # are ignored;
- Image slide: paragraph containing @FILENAME
- Empty slide: just use a \ as a paragraph

# This is a comment and will not be part of the presentation

# Multiple empty lines between paragraphs are also ignored


\

\#This line as well
Prepend a backslash to kill behaviour of special characters

Presentation styling:
- Configuration options from breeze
- All configuration options are comments
  that start with a dot: #.
- Because they're comments, they're
  backwards-compatible with sent

- Font: #.font:Noto Sans
- Foreground colour: #.fg:#000000
- Background colour: #.bg:#ffffff

If multiple fonts are specified, the
first one that is found is used

Thank you.
